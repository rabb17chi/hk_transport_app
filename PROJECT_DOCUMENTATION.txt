HONG KONG TRANSPORT TIME CHECKER APP - PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
This Flutter application is designed to provide real-time transport information for Hong Kong's public transportation system. The app serves as a mobile version of the web application found at: https://hk-transport-time-checker.vercel.app/

The application focuses on two main transport modes:
1. MTR (Mass Transit Railway) - Hong Kong's subway system
2. KMB (Kowloon Motor Bus) - Hong Kong's bus system

CORE FUNCTIONALITIES
====================

1. MTR MODE
-----------
- Interactive MTR map with clickable station buttons
- Station selection interface for checking train arrival times
- Real-time API integration to fetch incoming train information
- Display of next 4 incoming trains with time differences
- Visual representation of the MTR network

Key Features:
- Full MTR map display with all stations
- Station selection mechanism
- Real-time train arrival data
- Time difference calculations for upcoming trains
- User-friendly interface for station selection

2. BUS (KMB) MODE
-----------------
- Bus route input and selection system
- Station selection for chosen bus route
- Real-time API integration for bus arrival information
- Display of next 3 incoming buses with time differences
- Route and station management

Key Features:
- Bus route search and selection
- Station selection within chosen route
- Real-time bus arrival data
- Time difference calculations for upcoming buses
- Efficient route and stop management
