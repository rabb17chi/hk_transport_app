HONG KONG TRANSPORT TIME CHECKER APP - PROJECT DOCUMENTATION
================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW
================
This Flutter application is designed to provide real-time transport information for Hong Kong's public transportation system. The app serves as a mobile version of the web application found at: https://hk-transport-time-checker.vercel.app/

The application focuses on two main transport modes:
1. MTR (Mass Transit Railway) - Hong Kong's subway system
2. KMB (Kowloon Motor Bus) - Hong Kong's bus system

CORE FUNCTIONALITIES
====================

1. MTR MODE
-----------
- Interactive MTR map with clickable station buttons
- Station selection interface for checking train arrival times
- Real-time API integration to fetch incoming train information
- Display of next 4 incoming trains with time differences
- Visual representation of the MTR network

Key Features:
- Full MTR map display with all stations
- Station selection mechanism
- Real-time train arrival data
- Time difference calculations for upcoming trains
- User-friendly interface for station selection

2. BUS (KMB) MODE
-----------------
- Bus route input and selection system
- Station selection for chosen bus route
- Real-time API integration for bus arrival information
- Display of next 3 incoming buses with time differences
- Route and station management

Key Features:
- Bus route search and selection
- Station selection within chosen route
- Real-time bus arrival data
- Time difference calculations for upcoming buses
- Efficient route and stop management

- Intuitive user interface
- Fast and responsive performance
- Reliable API integration
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Offline functionality where possible

DATA OPERATIONS - FIRST APP INSTALLATION
=========================================

When users first install and launch the app, several data operations are automatically performed to ensure optimal functionality and user experience.

1. SYSTEM INFORMATION CAPTURE
-----------------------------
Upon first launch, the app captures and stores critical system information:
- Text Scale Factor (user's accessibility text scaling setting)
- Device Pixel Ratio (screen density information)
- Screen Dimensions (width and height in logical pixels)
- Platform Brightness (light/dark mode preference)
- View Insets (keyboard, status bar dimensions)
- Safe Area Padding (notch, home indicator areas)

This information is stored in the SystemInfo class and used for:
- UI responsiveness optimization
- Overflow detection and prevention
- Accessibility compliance
- Screen scaling adjustments

2. SETTINGS INITIALIZATION
--------------------------
Default settings are applied during first installation:
- MTR Auto-Refresh: OFF (disabled by default)
- MTR Reverse Station Order: ON (enabled by default)
- KMB Special Routes: OFF (disabled by default)
- Theme Mode: System default
- Language: System default (English/Chinese)

These settings are stored in SharedPreferences and can be modified by users through the app's settings menu.

3. CACHE PREPARATION
-------------------
Initial cache structures are created for:
- KMB route data caching
- MTR station information
- User preferences storage
- System monitoring data

4. API SERVICE INITIALIZATION
-----------------------------
Background services are initialized for:
- MTR schedule service
- KMB API service
- Cache management service
- Settings service
- Vibration feedback service

5. LOCALIZATION SETUP
---------------------
The app prepares localization data for:
- English (en)
- Traditional Chinese - Hong Kong (zh_HK)
- Traditional Chinese (zh)

Language detection and fallback mechanisms are established.

6. THEME SYSTEM INITIALIZATION
------------------------------
Material Design 3 theming is set up with:
- Light theme configuration
- Dark theme configuration
- Custom color schemes (AppColorScheme)
- Responsive design tokens

7. SYSTEM MONITORING ACTIVATION
-------------------------------
A system monitoring section is created in the settings menu that displays:
- Current scaling information
- Screen dimensions and available space
- Scaling status and recommendations
- System performance metrics

This helps users understand their device's scaling settings and provides recommendations for optimal UI experience.

8. ERROR HANDLING PREPARATION
-----------------------------
Initial error handling mechanisms are established for:
- Network connectivity issues
- API service failures
- Data parsing errors
- User input validation

9. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION
---------------------------
First-run optimizations include:
- Lazy loading of heavy components
- Efficient memory management
- Background task scheduling
- Resource preloading

10. USER EXPERIENCE ENHANCEMENT
-------------------------------
Initial UX features are activated:
- Haptic feedback system
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Accessibility features

IMPORTANT NOTES
===============
- All first-installation operations are performed silently in the background
- No user interaction is required during initialization
- System information is captured only once at startup
- Settings can be modified by users at any time
- Cache data is automatically managed and updated
- The app gracefully handles initialization failures

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
===================
- Additional transport modes (Tram, Ferry, etc.)
- Route planning and navigation
- Favorites and saved routes
- Push notifications for delays
- Multi-language support
- Accessibility features

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for the development of the Hong Kong Transport Time Checker mobile application, ensuring all requirements and features are properly implemented and documented.
